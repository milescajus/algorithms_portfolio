## Simple Binary Tree C# Implementation

`Trees.cs` contains two classes: one simple binary tree node class, and a main class to implement and populate the tree. The code takes the same `scores.txt` data as used in previous exercises, sorts it using C#'s Array.Sort method\*, and creates a binary tree to store the data.

\* [Microsoft C# API Documentation: Array.Sort](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.array.sort?view=net-6.0#System_Array_Sort_System_Array_)
This method uses one of insertion sort, heapsort, or quicksort depending on the size and structure of the array.
